# UNSW-NB15 And NSL-KDD

This repository presents binary and multi-class classification results on two widely used network intrusion detection datasets: NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. Several machine learning models including Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Naive Bayes were evaluated using sampling techniques (SMOTE-Tomek), GridSearchCV, and confusion matrix visualizations.

âœ… Key Features:
Binary & Multi-class classification experiments
Model performance comparison using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy
Evaluation on imbalanced data with SMOTE-Tomek resampling
Confusion matrix plots for detailed error analysis
Supports reproducibility and extension
